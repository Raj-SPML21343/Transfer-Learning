Transfer Learning makes your classification task easier by building on the efforts of others. It's a game-changer for small datasets, delivering impressive accuracies. Utilizing models trained on vast datasets, we fine-tune them to yield powerful results.I classified ants and bees dataset by finetuning Alexnet and VGGnet and got nearly 90% accuracy with a small dataset of size 209 images.
